# Nerdery Front-end NAT

## Introduction

We have a mock project we'd like you to finish. Below you'll find the instructions for what we'd like you to do. Please know that in our real projects we have a pretty cool build process we typically use, however, in the interest of not excluding any of our potential candidates we have chosen to remove any preprocessors or build tools. If you would like to add any of these tools to help you with your development feel free but they are not required. If you do add any build tools, please be sure to submit your source files as well.

Most of the sites we work on are responsive. However, making this NAT responsive increases the time it takes for both our candidates and our reviewers. Because of that, this NAT is not responsive. With that said, still try to write your code in a way that would be conducive to making the site responsive.

We intend for this to take less than 8 hours. Please don't spend more than 12 hours because, frankly, we value your time. If you think you may go over, we recommend commenting on how you'd accomplish certain tasks.

## Instructions

You have been provided with some partially completed code and a PSD showing what the final site should look like. Please take this asset and turn it into a fully functional static page that could be used for integration with a yet to be determined CMS. The code you have been provided with is meant to assist you in completing the tasks in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to modify and add to the provided code as you see fit. This will be a much larger site than a single page, and your code should be written to be flexible and reusable throughout the site. Show us your best start to a code base that will be scalable, flexible, maintainable, semantic and accessible. Build in a progressively enhanced manner - attention to detail should be high, but minor aesthetic details may differ depending on the native functionality of each required browser. As you make these decisions, justify them in a README file.

## Challenge Requirements

- Browser Support
    - IE8+
    - Chrome - Latest Stable Release
    - Firefox - Latest Stable Release
    - Safari - Latest Stable Release
- Build Tools
    - If build tools are used, please provide the source files and a working build that is not minified / uglified.
- Frameworks, Plugins, and Polyfills
    - With the exception of jQuery, please avoid frameworks, plugins and polyfills for HTML, CSS, & JS - We’d like to see what you’re capable of doing when handcrafting your own code
- Carousel
    - Add pagination dots to the carousel that update as the carousel rotates
    - Add the previous and next arrows to the carousel that bring the user to the previous or next slide.
- Media

- Design Accuracy
    - Make sure the design matches the PSD in all required browsers
    - If you choose to make your site responsive (not required), keep in mind that pixel perfection must be achieved for the breakpoint implied in the PSD with which you were provided.
