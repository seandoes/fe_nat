Thanks for reviewing my NAT!

Two things I want to point out:
- The design has a white overflow at the top of the active nav item. I didn't accomplish this; I left notes in the CSS where I attempted. I tried to make up for it my making the carousel pips clicky so you can go right to a specific photo.
- I'd imagine there are issues with IE8. Frankly, I don't have capabilities to even look at the site in IE. I tried to stay away from unsupported pseudo-classes. I wanted to include selectivizr to handle what fell through the cracks, but the instructions said not to use plugins. So, this is a solid representation of my cross-browser skills by hand.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback.
